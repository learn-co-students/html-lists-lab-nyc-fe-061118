  Now, instead of just having each item show up on a new line, the content will also be slightly indented and a bullet will appear next to each of them.
  <ul>
    <li>2 slices of bread</li>
    <li>4 slices cheese
      <ul>
      <li>cheddar</li>
      <li>mozzarella</li>
      <li>pepper jack</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>1 tbsp of butter</li>
  </ul>
  Lists are very flexible and we can even nest lists inside of lists. Say we wanted to breakdown our favorite foods by category. We may have multiple categories and one or more items in each:
  <ol>
    <li>Spread butter on bread and frying pan</li>
    <li>Place bread in frying pan and fry</li>
    <li>Add cheese on top of bread</li>
    <li>Cover with second slice of bread</li>
    <li>Turn over and fry for 2 minutes</li>
  </ol>
